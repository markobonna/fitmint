## Next Priority Tasks

1. Complete MiniKit SDK integration with proper provider
2. Set up proper environment variables configuration
3. Implement Android configuration files according to spec
4. Create proper manifest.json for World App integration
5. Implement proper sync endpoint for mobile data
6. Set up proper testing environment

## Notes

- The core MVP functionality has largely been implemented
- The integration with World App MiniKit needs to be properly configured
- Mobile app has the core functionality but needs proper backend integration
- Mock endpoints need to be replaced with real data storage and retrieval
